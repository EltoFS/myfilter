# myfilter
My filter is an api used to rewrite something that you wish to send to someone.

If you are worried that your message is unprofessional, use the endpoint ``gentleman`` to rewrite it.

Do you want your message to be writen in a beautiful haiku? no problem, use the endpoint ``sage``

# How to use it
- Install the requirements using the requirements.txt file (a virtual environment is highly recommended): ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

- run the project using ``flask run â€”port 8000``
- request send a ``GET`` request with a Json body, request body example:
    ``{"message": "your message here"}``
